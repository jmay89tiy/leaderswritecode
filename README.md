# leaderswritecode - https://jmay89tiy.github.io/leaderswritecode/Home.html
This is the beginning of a small portfolio project I started working on to showcase some things I've been working on lately. 


TO DO:

- I need to add a portfolio gallery section
- I need to launch the site to it's new domain Leaderswritecode.com on github pages
- I need to explore added additional functionality with onhover affects for collaboration partners/projects
- I need to create contact information
