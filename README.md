This is the beginning of a small portfolio project I started working on to showcase some things I've been working on lately. 


TO DO:

- I need to add a portfolio gallery section
- I need to launch the site to it's new domain Leaderswritecode.com on github pages
- I need to explore added additional functionality with onhover affects for collaboration partners/projects


Future Enhancements: 

- Adding onHover functionality to all previous groups/customers/projects to display descriptions of each
- Adding downloadable updated resume in PDF form
- Adding Credentials and Awards section
- Adding Hobbies and Free Time section
- Adding Tech Interests section
- Adding enhanced animations for banner
