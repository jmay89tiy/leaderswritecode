        <h4 class="subheading">I would argue that learning the front-end comes first.</h4>
        <p>I learned Front-End development way before we started learning the ins and outs of the backend, and pound for
          pound have spent the majority of my web development
          career focused on writing clean, concise, Front-End code. Having a solid foundation in JavaScript in
          particular has been the greatest boon to my success in the development
          world. It's often times overlooked and considered the "easy" route by upskilling a new language just enough to
          where you can resolve a problem but, I took things a step further and read over 1000
          pages of various books ranging from authors such as David Flannagan's "JavaScript The Definitive Guide" and
          other literature that really fill in the "gaps" that
          are often times overlooked with JavaScript. I also have a great foundation for HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design
          concepts. </p>

        <p>I have experience launching builds and maintaining the technology needed to power the components enabling the user-facing side of web applications.
          Writing anything from REST API's, creating classes that be be reused across various projects, and leveraging complex processes sever-side to ensure performance remains at it's best is just a 
          part of what I do on a regular basis. In addition, I have to interact with not only lots of C# code, but tools that enrich how we interact with a database like Entity Frameworks, LINQ, and experience working with
          Microsoft SQL database to achieve desirable results on our front-end. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) has helped me 
          problem solve more affectively by creating more maintainable, reusable, and testable code as a whole.</p>

        <p>Modern leadership has advanced far beyond just telling people what to do. To me, leadership is a skill set that runs deeper 
           than goals we are trying to accomplish placing more of an emphasis on how you work with others to reach those goals. At the helm, Communication skills are critical when
           collaborating with others in the tech industry where you're often tasked with hard deadlines, complex requirements, and experience communication challenges between technical and non-technical groups. 
           Working in a plethora of different industries and consumer facing roles really refined my ability to act confidently as a leader when required, collaborate with others to achieve goals, and deliver calmly
           under stressful circumstances. Above all else showing empathy, communicating affectively with others, and maintaining a great attitude are all keys to my success and a mainstay in how I approach providing any solution. </p>

        very passionate about. I play all kinds of soccer locally, pickup, futsal, and even participate in some local leagues. I really enjoy watching the New York Rangers play hockey,
         traveling the globe, and working on projects that use new technologies. Collaborating with others on cool side project is a blast so if you have a game idea or a fun web app I'd love to hear it.
         I have a ton of little hobbies I try and dabble in that are left over from the years of trying new things like outdoorsy stuff, Jiu-Jitsu, skate boarding, and surfing. I can't leave out music,
         I really love a live show if the band is good!

Naturally I was very excited because I have been looking at the Vue.js framework for a long time and was on the fence about whether I should choose React or even Angular. I'm glad I got the push over the edge that I needed to start down the path of learning Vue.js as a front-end framework. I already write in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS frequently so picking up Vue.js was fairly easy. This Paragraph is ironically a drop in Vue.js component! Instead of refactoring entire apps with React, Vue.js allows me to plug in Vue components when I need them, where I need them, and that added flexibility goes a long way in the work that I'm doing with various Sharepoint related sites and legacy code. Enjoy!",
